# StickIt

StickIt is a sticky note emulator that allows users to create, move, resize and re-color virtual sticky notes. 

For users, the "+Add Note" button will create a note, and each note uses the customary move and resize interactivity.

For developers, creating and modifying new notes is a simple process:
```
var someNote = new Note();
someNote.setfColor('#fff');
someNote.sfx = someEffect;
```
